Homework 2 of Stat 159, Spring 2023 at UC Berkeley. Contains a copy of the LIGO Gravitational Wave Detection Tutorial Notebook. All coe and data is based on the original [LIGO Center for Open Science Tutorial Repository](https://github.com/losc-tutorial/LOSC_Event_tutorial). This repository is a class exercise that restructures the original LIGO code for improved reproducibility.
